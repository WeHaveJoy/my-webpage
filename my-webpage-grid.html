            <lu>
                <li>The area known as District Six got its name from having been the Sixth Municipal District
                    of Cape Town in 1867. </li>
                <li>Its earlier unofficial name was Kanaldorp, a name supposedly
                    derived from the the series of canals running
                    across the city,some of which had to be crossed in
                    order to reach the District
                    (kanaal is the Afrikaans for ‘canal’.)</li>
                <li>District Six before its destruction under Apartheid, was a
                    community representative of diversity on a number
                    of levels – language, religion,
                    economic class, geographical area of origin – and became a living example
                    of how diversity could a be a strengthening characteristic of a community
                    and need not be feared.</li>

            <lu>
                    <li>Cape Town's City Hall took five years to complete, after the laying of its cornerstone in 1900.</li>
                    <li>Nelson Mandela gave a speech from the balcony of City Hall immediately upon his release from prison.
                    </li>
                    <li>City Hall lies between Buitengracht and Darling Streets, its forecourt,
                        known as Grand Parade, the scene of many military and political gatherings
                        whilst its balcony became notably famous when Nelson Mandela addressed 100 000 jubilant
                        people just hours after his release from prison, on 11 February 1990 (he was to borrow Winnie's
              (his then wife, Winne Mandela) glasses to read, having left his in prison).</li>
